The SIT will be formed based on the  interim report submitted by retired High Court judge Michael D’Cunha on  Covid-19 irregularities submitted to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on August 31  this year.

However, without the support of either Muslim or Hindu voters, Congress has been completely defeated in Jammu and Kashmir.
“In the 2014 Assembly elections, Congress won 12 seats with an 18 percent vote share.

But in 2024, it has been reduced to just 6 seats with a mere 12 percent vote share.

Out of the 29 seats Congress contested in Hindu-majority Jammu, it managed to win only one seat.

On the other hand, the BJP, which had won 25 seats in 2014, increased its tally to 29 seats in 2024.

With 25.64 percent of the vote share, the BJP has surpassed the National Conference Party, becoming the leading party in terms of vote share,” he added.
He added that it is high time for Congress leaders in Karnataka to wake up and shift their focus from appeasement and vote-bank politics towards development.
“Otherwise, the fate that befell Congress in Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana will inevitably repeat itself in Karnataka as well,” he added.

Sreelekha is the  first woman from Kerala to join IPS way back in 1987.

"I  served in the police department for over  33 and a half without aligning  with any political party.

The party will gain significantly from  the experience of the veteran officer known for her integrity and someone who  is also an accomplished writer.
 
Sreelekha retired from service in 2020 .

The EC data is lagging behind; they are still showing 4th or the 5th found data while 11 rounds have been counted.

We are confident that we are going to form the government with a majority in Jammu-Kashmir and Haryana."
Meanwhile, in Haryana BJP candidates are leading in 49 of the 90 constituencies in the state, while the main opponent Congress is leading in 35 of the seats.

4 Independents and 1 candidate each of the INLD and the BSP are also leading.

In an open letter written to the CM on Monday, the BJLP leaders disputed the state government's claim of extending the farm loan waiver to 22.22 lakh farmers in the state.

The letter by Revanth Reddy talked about allocating `26,000 crore for the scheme and later mentioned about the Cabinet approval for Rs 31,000 crore.

Maheshwar Reddy pointed out that the state government had said Rs 49,500 crore was required to waive the loan of all eligible farmers in the state-level bankers' committee meeting.

However, only `17,869 crore were waived off covering 22 lakh farmers between July 18 to August 15.

It is not clear that only 50 per cent of the farmers were covered under the scheme, he said.

“It is estimated that about 70 lakh farmers have taken loans from various banks.

To escape from its responsibility, the Congress government waived farm loans of less than 50 per cent of the farmers.

Minister Vaishnaw also shared that the Indian Railways is investing Rs.73,743 crore in infrastructure projects across Andhra Pradesh, which include the four-laning of the Howrah-Chennai rail corridor, modernising 73 railway stations, and expanding local train services.
