Hyderabad: 
The BJP has enrolled 20 lakh members in the state so far in its current membership drive, against its target of 50 lakh.

Of this, 15 lakh people received the membership through application forms, while the remaining used the Missed Call option.

The party has already appointed 7,000 Shakti Kendras to monitor and conduct the membership drive.

Ramchander Rao pointed out that in the second phase, party workers who enrolled 100 or more members would be granted active membership and get responsibilities in the party's programmes.

After the active membership phase, the party will make appointments at the booth, mandal, and district levels by November 15.

Party leaders admit that, although they may not reach the 50 lakh target this time, they aim to reach at least 35 to 40 lakh members.

The partyâ€™s membership tally from its previous drive, conducted about three years ago, was only 11.75 lakh.

Despite this, neither the Congress, BJP, nor the ED has made any statement," he said.
On September 27, ED conducted raids at Telangana Minister of Information and Public Relations, Ponguleti Srinivasa Reddy's residence and premises linked to his son Harsha Reddy, who is a promoter of Raghav Group for alleged Hawala transactions.
The ED investigated the case against Harsha Reddy, who allegedly purchased seven watches for Rs.

5 crores through Crypto and Hawala smuggling racket of more than Rs.

100 crores.
Another instance he mentioned was the ED's "revelation" that Rs 40 crore linked to the Valmiki scam in Karnataka were transferred to Telangana, and claiming that despite the revelations no arrests or formal investigation has happened.
"The ED's revelation that Rs 40 crore, linked to the Valmiki scam in Karnataka, was funneled into Telangana by the Congress during the recent Parliamentary elections.

Kishan Reddy said the houses were constructed on the banks of the Musi about 30 to 40 years ago when the Congress was in power.

He asked the government to explain how it would raise Rs 1.5 lakh crore for the Musi development and said the costs incurred for the Ganga Rejuvenation Plan and Sabarmati Riverfront Development Project were much less.
