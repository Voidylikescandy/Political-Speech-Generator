There are many problems faced by the farmers

1.Insufficient Rainfall

2.Hiring of agricultural labourer has become expensive with labour cost shooting upto 200+ per day.

3.Fertilizers have jumped which raises the ultimate prices of crop too.

4.Farmers do not get support from Society & Government to face bad economic situations.

5.The most most major problem which every farmer facing is MARKETING RELATED ISSUE.

There is a huge difference between Retail price & Farm gate price.

Marketing still continues to be in a bad shape in rural areas. In the absence of sound marketing facilities, the farmers have to depend upon local traders and middlemen for the disposal of their farm produce which is sold at throw-away price.

6.Seeds:

Distribution of assured quality seed is as critical as the production of such seeds. Unfortunately, good quality seeds are out of reach of the majority of farmers.

7.Fertilizers:

Soils have been used for growing crops over thousands of years without caring much for replenishing. This has led to depletion and exhaustion of soils resulting in their low productivity. The average yields of almost all the crops are among t e lowest in the world. This is a serious problem which can be solved by using more manures and fertilizers.

8.Real Estate: Fertile lands are turning into real estate lands.

Greenish mats becoming concrete walls.
