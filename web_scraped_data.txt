Despite this, neither the Congress, BJP, nor the ED has made any statement," he said.
On September 27, ED conducted raids at Telangana Minister of Information and Public Relations, Ponguleti Srinivasa Reddy's residence and premises linked to his son Harsha Reddy, who is a promoter of Raghav Group for alleged Hawala transactions.
The ED investigated the case against Harsha Reddy, who allegedly purchased seven watches for Rs.

5 crores through Crypto and Hawala smuggling racket of more than Rs.

100 crores.
Another instance he mentioned was the ED's "revelation" that Rs 40 crore linked to the Valmiki scam in Karnataka were transferred to Telangana, and claiming that despite the revelations no arrests or formal investigation has happened.
"The ED's revelation that Rs 40 crore, linked to the Valmiki scam in Karnataka, was funneled into Telangana by the Congress during the recent Parliamentary elections.

Kishan Reddy said the houses were constructed on the banks of the Musi about 30 to 40 years ago when the Congress was in power.

He asked the government to explain how it would raise Rs 1.5 lakh crore for the Musi development and said the costs incurred for the Ganga Rejuvenation Plan and Sabarmati Riverfront Development Project were much less.

They particularly discussed converting the GO 111, meant to protect Himayatsagar and Osmansagar, into a sustainable development zone, reclaiming the temple land in Sitarampuram village of Shabad mandal that were previously taken over by the Bast TRS government, and improving the management of sewage treatment plants in the twin cities.

In an open letter written to the CM on Monday, the BJLP leaders disputed the state government's claim of extending the farm loan waiver to 22.22 lakh farmers in the state.

The letter by Revanth Reddy talked about allocating `26,000 crore for the scheme and later mentioned about the Cabinet approval for Rs 31,000 crore.

Maheshwar Reddy pointed out that the state government had said Rs 49,500 crore was required to waive the loan of all eligible farmers in the state-level bankers' committee meeting.

However, only `17,869 crore were waived off covering 22 lakh farmers between July 18 to August 15.

It is not clear that only 50 per cent of the farmers were covered under the scheme, he said.

“It is estimated that about 70 lakh farmers have taken loans from various banks.

To escape from its responsibility, the Congress government waived farm loans of less than 50 per cent of the farmers.

We will not allow the ministers to come on to national highway 44, which connects north Telangana to the city if the metro is not expanded up to Medchal, he said.

Meanwhile, a number of organisations under the banner of Metro Sadhana Samithi staged a dharna demanding the state government to extend the Metro from JBS to Medchal on NH 161 and from JBS to Shamirpet on the Rajiv Highway.

In an open letter to the Chief Minister, Rajendar asked if it was justifiable to provide 2BHK units to the oustees after demolishing their houses and taking over crores of rupees worth of land.

Rajendar pointed out that most of the people had built pucca houses on the patta land given by the state government about 40 years ago, in layouts approved by the municipal bodies concerned.

Rajendar said the Gujarat government had spent Rs 2,000 crore to clean the Sabarmati river and the UP government and the Centre spent Rs 22,000 crore for Namami Ganga project and asked why the Musi project would cost Rs 1.5 lakh crore.

In the letter, Reddy gave a detailed description about the distribution schedule, stating that Phase 1 saw Rs 6,034.97 crores disbursed to 11,34,412 loan accounts on July, 18.

During the Phase 2, over Rs 6,190.01 crore was disbursed to 6,40,823 accounts and it completed on July 30.

In the Phase 3, on August 15, Rs 5,644.24 crore was disbursed to 4,46,832 loan accounts, with the waiver extending up to Rs 2 lakhs per farmer, he stated

The Chief Minister also expressed his commitment to covering farmers whose loans exceeded Rs 2 lakh.

Once the farmers repay the excess amount, the government would disburse the promised Rs 2 lakhs.

The Congress government has plans to invest up to Rs 31,000 crore into the waiver scheme this year, alongside a proposed budget of Rs 26,000 crore, he said in the letter.

He posted a tweet on X stating that: "In our Government…every crop loan below Rs 2 lakh was waived totally as promised.

This covered a total of 22,22,067 farmers, with an amount of Rs 17,869.22 crore - the single largest farm loan waiver since #Telangana was formed.

We will soon be implementing waiver for farmers who have a loan of above Rs 2 lakh…once they clear the amount above the Rs 2,00,000 limit.
