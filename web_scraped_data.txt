Hyderabad:
 With a resolve to force the Congress government to fulfil its poll promises, including the Six Guarantees to the people before the Assembly elections, the Telangana BJP will launch a 24-hour rythu deeksha at Dharna Chowk near Indira Park on Monday.

Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, party Malkajgiri MP Etala Rajendar pointed out that banks had indicated that 73 lakh farmers had availed farm loans. Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy had promised to extend the benefit to 65 lakh farmers and later reduced it to 48 lakh farmers, he said.
After giving an assurance of a one-time loan waiver to the tune of Rs 34,000 crore, the Congress government had extended the benefit to only a section of farmers by releasing Rs 17,000 crore.
Calling upon the farming community to join the protest, Rajendar said that the BJP has chalked out the programme to relieve the farming community from the debt trap.
BJP legislature party leader A. Maheshwar Reddy charged that the Congress government had cheated all sections of the society by making tall promises.

“We are checking their background and call records even the CI cell and SB are investigating separately. We have searched their houses. During questioning they revealed that Muslims from Indiranagar in Mangalhat were harassing them in Allapur, Borabanda, for which they wanted to seek Raja Singh’s help,” Goshamahal ACP K. Venkat Reddy told Deccan Chronicle.
Meanwhile T Raja Singh in a video released on Sunday said, “I came to know about Ismail and Khaja through social media, and called up Mangalhat inspector. I was told that when special police opened their Whatsapp they found my pictures, videos and live location of my house that they had sent to a person through Whatsapp in Mumbai.”
Reportedly an IB team on Sunday collected details of Khaja and Ismail to investigate if they had a nexus with terrorist organisation. The city intelligence cell have alerted Mumbai ATS (Anti-Terrorism Squad) to check details of the person to whom these two had sent the MLA's pictures, locations, video and pictures of his house, reliable sources disclosed. Singh also confirmed that he was told by the police that a IB team was looking into the case.
