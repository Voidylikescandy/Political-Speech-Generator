My dear fellow citizens,

Allow me to share the heartwarming story of a farmer named Ramesh, whose life has seen a remarkable transformation. Ramesh, like many farmers in our country, worked tirelessly every day to support his family, but his journey was fraught with challenges and hardship. His story reflects the struggles many farmers faced under previous leadership and the significant changes brought about under our government.

Before our government came to power, Ramesh faced countless difficulties. His crops frequently failed due to the lack of a proper irrigation system. Despite numerous promises, electricity was scarce and unreliable, flickering like the hope he once held. Corruption siphoned funds meant to aid his agricultural development, leading to monumental losses. Farmers like Ramesh were left feeling abandoned, with unfulfilled promises and little hope for the future.

Water scarcity, erratic monsoons, soil degradation, and pest infestations only made his life more difficult, driving him deeper into debt. The stress and uncertainty of each harvest season weighed heavily on him and his family, leaving them trapped in a cycle of despair.

But then, change arrived. When our government took office, we recognized the urgent need to support farmers like Ramesh. One of the first initiatives we introduced was the PM-KISAN scheme, providing direct financial support to farmers. This allowed Ramesh to invest in better seeds and advanced farming technology, bringing new life to his land. We also ensured widespread electrification, and today, over 99% of villages, including Ramesh’s, have access to reliable electricity. His farm now thrives, radiating hope and success.

Our efforts didn’t stop there. We improved irrigation systems, promoted efficient water use, and introduced advanced pest management technologies. These initiatives transformed Ramesh’s farming conditions, turning his once barren fields into fertile land filled with promise. Where there was once worry and despair, there are now smiles of relief and optimism for the future.

Ramesh’s wife, like many others in rural India, once cooked on a traditional chulha, inhaling harmful fumes every day. Despite past promises, only a fraction of rural women had access to clean cooking fuel. But under our Ujjwala Yojana, millions of women, including Ramesh’s wife, now have gas connections. Breathing healthier air, his family enjoys a much-improved quality of life.

Road conditions, too, were a major issue for Ramesh. Poor infrastructure meant he struggled to transport his produce to markets. But under our government, the pace of highway construction has doubled, and Ramesh can now easily transport his crops, leading to higher incomes and better opportunities. With improved market access and stabilized pricing, Ramesh's hard work translates into tangible financial stability for his family.

Under previous governments, Ramesh’s village was digitally isolated, cut off from the benefits of modern technology. Today, thanks to our Digital India campaign, Ramesh’s village enjoys internet access, opening up new opportunities, better education, and improved connectivity to the world beyond the village.

Finally, corruption in the distribution of subsidies and aid was rampant, and middlemen took significant cuts from funds meant for farmers like Ramesh. This bred frustration and a sense of helplessness. Our direct benefit transfer system changed that. Now, Ramesh receives funds directly, saving significant amounts from corrupt practices and fostering a sense of fairness and security.

Ramesh's story is not just about one farmer; it represents millions of farmers across the nation. While past governments left a legacy of unfulfilled promises, we have delivered meaningful change, restoring hope and dignity to India's farmers.

Together, we have built a stronger, more prosperous India, and together we will continue this journey toward a brighter future. Let us move forward with trust, integrity, and a shared vision of greatness.

Thank you. Jai Hind!

Good morning, everyone,
Today, I stand before you to discuss the pressing issues faced by our beloved nation due to the current government's policies. We are a resilient people, but the burdens placed upon us are becoming too heavy to bear. Our farmers, the backbone of our country, are struggling more than ever before. The promises made to them have not been kept, and they continue to face the threat of losing their livelihoods.
Small businesses, which are the heartbeat of our economy, are being crushed under the weight of excessive regulations and unfair taxes. The GST regime, in its current form, has been a disaster for these entrepreneurs. Unemployment rates are skyrocketing, and our youth, full of potential and dreams, are left disillusioned and frustrated.
The education sector is in shambles, with underfunded schools and overburdened teachers. Our children deserve better; they deserve a future where quality education is a right, not a privilege. Healthcare is another area where the government has failed us. The pandemic exposed the inadequacies of our system, and instead of strengthening it, the government has chosen to ignore the warning signs.
Women's safety is a grave concern. Despite tall claims of women empowerment, incidents of violence and discrimination against women are on the rise. Our environment is being neglected, with policies that Favor industrialists over sustainable development. Air and water pollution are at alarming levels, posing serious health risks to our citizens.
The freedom of the press is under attack. Journalists who dare to speak the truth face intimidation and violence. Our democratic institutions are being undermined, and dissent is being stifled. We must protect the sanctity of our Constitution and the principles of democracy.
The current government has failed to address the rising cost of living. Inflation is eating into the savings of the common man, and essential commodities are becoming unaffordable. There is a growing sense of insecurity among our minorities, who feel marginalized and targeted by divisive policies.

Imagine you are Modi from the BJP government addressing the problems faced by the people due to policies made by the existing government
Create a compelling story about a person Aruna, who has suffered under the present Congress government, detailing their journey from childhood to adulthood. Include the struggles and challenges faced by their parents in ensuring they received an education, and highlight specific policies or socio-economic factors that contributed to their hardships. Make sure to illustrate the emotional and personal impact on the individual and their family throughout the years. Make the speech rhetorical, ask questions, make the people think, let them understand how beneficial it is to have BJP government aid them in their journey.

My fellow citizens,
Today, I stand before you not just as the Prime Minister of India but as a servant of this great nation, bound by the commitment to bring about real change for every Indian. For decades, we have witnessed how previous governments, especially the Congress, have run this country like a personal fiefdom, filled with corruption, mismanagement, and unfulfilled promises. The aspirations of millions of Indians were sacrificed at the altar of self-interest.
We have seen corruption deeply entrenched in every institution during the Congress-led regimes. The scams under their watch were countless—whether it was the 2G scam, the coal scam, or the Commonwealth Games scandal. Thousands of crores of rupees that belonged to the people were siphoned off by a select few, leaving the common man with broken promises and shattered dreams.
Under the Congress government, the idea of public service was reduced to an excuse for personal gain. Essential sectors like education, healthcare, and infrastructure suffered, while the country’s hard-earned money was pocketed by corrupt leaders and their associates. Instead of creating opportunities for the people, they created opportunities for themselves.
Over the years, you, the people of India, have been promised a bright future, an end to poverty, better employment opportunities, and a prosperous nation. But these promises remained empty words. The Congress government failed to deliver even the most basic of services—electricity, clean drinking water, proper roads, and jobs. We were told that our country was progressing, but the reality was that their policies only widened the gap between the rich and the poor.
When we, the BJP, came to power, we vowed to clean up this mess. We didn’t make empty promises; we focused on action. We launched a decisive battle against corruption. We enacted tough laws and empowered investigative agencies to take action without fear or favor. The black money hoarded by corrupt politicians and businessmen is now being brought back to the people.
Through initiatives like Swachh Bharat, Digital India, and Make in India, we have focused on making India cleaner, more transparent, and self-reliant. We have modernized infrastructure, ensured that essential services reach even the most remote villages, and made significant strides in sectors like healthcare and education. The Jan Dhan Yojana has given every Indian a chance to participate in the banking system, and schemes like Ujjwala have brought dignity and better living conditions to millions of households.
In every decision we make, the interest of the common man comes first. We are making a government that works for the people, with the people. Our efforts have always been to lift the poor and marginalized, to bring them into the mainstream of India’s growth story.
But my dear citizens, this is just the beginning. To completely rid our country of the legacy of corruption and inefficiency left behind by previous regimes, we need your support, your faith, and your commitment. Together, we are building a new India—one that is strong, prosperous, and respected on the global stage.
I promise you that this government will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that every Indian, regardless of caste, creed, or economic status, benefits from the fruits of development. We are not just cleaning the mess; we are laying the foundation for a brighter, cleaner, and more prosperous future for generations to come.
Together, let us build the India of our dreams—a country free of corruption, full of opportunity, and united in its diversity.
Jai Hind!
